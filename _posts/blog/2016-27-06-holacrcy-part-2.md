This is part two of a series about Holacracy - [part 1](upday.github.io/blog/holacrcy-part-1/) 


### Governance

Ok, you discovered a tension - but how to handle it now? Holacracy provides a sophisticated set of rules
which allows to alter the organizational structure in a way that allows to resolve the tension and moving to 
new opportunities.<br>
All meetings in Holacracy follow a strict set of rules and the Governance meeting is no exception. The meeting
is splitted into:
* Check-in round - space to get settled for the meeting and call out all distractions
* Administrative Concerns - how long is the meeting
* Agenda Building - Participants add tensions by using only one or two words and the facilitator of the meeting 
is adding them to a list
* Integrative Decision Making Process (see below)
* Closing round - each participant has the chance to share a closing reflection about the meeting

That is a lot of structure for a simple meeting... Brian J. Robertson describes the necessity of such a sophisticated
structure by comparing it to the rules of a balls game. As long as you are familiar with the rules you are able to watch 
or play the game without any disturbances. They become second nature and implicit. This is, until the rules are broken.
Then the game is stopped and appropriate action is taken, so that the game can return to its smooth flow. And as it is in soccer,
if you would just pick up the ball and run around with it - the gae simply wouldn't work. <br>
But let's go back to the parts of a governance meeting.<br>
The *Check-in round* is used to give every participant the chance to settle down and focus solely on the meeting. 

In the next blog post of this series, I'll describe the experiences that we made with Holacracy and why we decided for us that
it is not our way to go.
 
### tl;dr
**Governance** .
