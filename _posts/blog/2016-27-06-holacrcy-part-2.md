### Governance

Ok, you discovered a tension - but how to handle it now? Holacracy provides a sophisticated set of rules
which allows to alter the organizational structure in a way that allows to resolve the tension and moving to 
new opportunities.<br>
All meetings in Holacracy follow a strict set of rules and the Governance meeting is no exception. The meeting
is splitted into:
* Check-in round - space to get settled for the meeting and call out all distractions
* Administrative Concerns - how long is the meeting
* Agenda Building - Participants add tensions by using only one or two words and the facilitator of the meeting 
is adding them to a list
* Integrative Decision Making Process (see below)
* Closing round - each participant has the chance to share a closing reflection about the meeting

That is a lot of structure for a simple meeting... Brian J. Robertson describes the necessity of such a sophisticated
structure by comparing it to the rules of a balls game. As long as you are familiar with the rules you are able to watch 
or play the game without any disturbances. They become second nature and implicit. This is, until the rules are broken.
Then the game is stopped and appropriate action is taken, so that the game can return to its smooth flow. And as it is in soccer,
if you would just pick up the ball and run around with it - the gae simply wouldn't work. <br>
But let's go back to the parts of a governance meeting.<br>
The *Check-in round* is used to give every participant the chance to settle down and focus solely on the meeting. 

 

What is the right way to be happy, productive and innovative as possible? Well, I guess this question 
pops up in many companies and there are many books out there that gives an answer to this question. 
However I deeply believe that there isnˋt  -“the one to bind them all”. But some principles are for sure 
helpful to create a healthy environment - this means for us updudes:

* Independence - you need the freedom to make your own decisions
* You need to know what you are responsible for
* You need to know what you can expect from others - so what they are responsible/accountable for

If all this conditions comes true the probability that you finish your task with the highest quality, 
pretty efficient and even have some fun in the meantime, is pretty high.
One guide which is on every ones lips in the moment is Holacracy. So we decided to have a closer look 
and realized that it isn’t the silver bullet (such a surprise), but it includes many tools that we 
started using to come closer to our Garden Eden.

I will describe in the next sections some key aspects of Holacracy and in the next series of post our 
experiences with it.

### The CTO is dead - long live the constitution

The classical hierarchical system - one person is in charge and makes every decision - worked for a few 
hundred years pretty well. It assumes that this person is able to make the best possible decision 
because she understands every required workflow and still has the big picture overall. This goes true 
for some assembly lines - like producing pralines. Becomes already unlikely if you think about fully 
automated, robot driven assembly lines in car production. Is completely impossible in an agile fast 
changing software development process. 
What could be the alternative? Anarchy, base democratic decisions or maybe hire an almighty genius who 
knows everything?
The answer that Holacracy provides is an accurate set of rules to shift the power to a constitution 
which is binding for every member of the organization. As like in every other constitution driven 
culture, this brings the freedom to make your own decisions as long as you stick to the rules. 
The provocative title of this section could suggest that Holacracy isn’t a hierarchical system - far 
from it! There is still someone or even a group of people who makes decisions for the whole company, a 
bit like a government may decide to build an airport, but all the practical choices are made by someone 
who actually knows how to construct a runway or a hangar (maybe a bad example for a Berlin based company :-) )
The main purpose of the constitution is to provide “roles” (who is accountable for what) and governance processes 
(fix or improve the roles).


### Role vs. Soul vs. Circle
The definition of a role consists of three elements:

 * A purpose 
 * Domains to control
 * Set of accountabilities and corresponding domains
 Only the purpose is mandatory, the accountabilities and domains can evolve over time. As an example you can have a look at the developer role from GlassFrog - 
 which is a web based tool developed by HolacracyOne. 
 
**Developer**
**Purpose**
Satisfy the customer, with Product Vision as proxy, through early and continuous delivery of truly valuable software

**Accountabilities**

 * Implementing GlassFrog user stories, bug fixes, and chores in alignment with: 
 * development practices set by Scrum Master 
 * implementation standards set by Quality Guardian
 * Testing new functionality before each production deployment
 * Providing input into estimation at the request of Scrum Master
 * Sharing development challenges with Product Vision, API Product Designer, and Developer as challenges arise
 * Demonstrating working software to Product Vision regularly and frequently, and integrating feedback surfaced by Product Vision
 
A definition like this makes it explicit what you can expect from a developer and on the other hand a dev 
knows what she/he is accountable for. 
But as the title of this sections says, there is a big difference between the persons who are working in 
an organization and the roles they fill. Decoupling these two elements allows improving the culture of 
an organization drastically. Conflicts in an organization are based on clashes on roles that are 
involved but they are mistaken them for clashes of the people who are filling the roles. This makes the 
conflicts personal and we try to resolve them by smoothing the relationships and miss the opportunity 
to resolve the underlying issue in the organization. For example, if I as an developer need time to 
unit test a feature this may clash with a product owner who wants a feature out as soon as possible. So 
it seems that she/he is not trusting your judgement. But in fact the conflict isn’t personnel at all, 
both of your are just filling your role and there is a tension that can be used to improve the organization 
even further. HolacrcyOne provides a nice video that explains nicely what a tension can be:

How does now the circles fit into the picture? Well actually a circle is just an accumulation of some 
roles that are all working together on a broader purpose. So basically you can say that if a role 
becomes too much for one person - it becomes a circle. It also follows the same rules - needs a purpose 
and a domain that it controls. In other words a circle has the autonomy and authority to self-organize 
all roles inside the circle. <br><br>   
This self-organization follows strict rules - which are called governance, which I will explain in my 
next post.
