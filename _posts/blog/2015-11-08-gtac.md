## GTAC 2015

I had the honor to be invited to the GTAC 2015 in Boston. It was my first visit to Boston and I have to admit it is a real beauty. I arrived one day before the GTAC started so I had the chance to walk through this tremendeous city. It is a great feeling to sit in the morning sun on the venerable Harvard campus and watch how the future elite trots to their lectures.

I also had to spend some time at Primark, because Air Berlin managed to forget my luggage in Berlin and I needed some clothes... But this is a different story.

Let's get down to business. There were several great talks. The scope of topics ranged from frameworks for mobile testing through talks about test processes up to massive test racks for Google Chromecast Sticks and roboters with highspeed cameras. The following selection of talks does not claim to be complete. But this were the sessions that impressed me the most.

### The Uber Challenge of Cross-Application/Cross-Device Testing

Uber presented a testing-framework that they implemented to allow ui based testing of interconnected (and cross plattform) apps like their driver and passenger app. If you are in the same situation and you try to automate a test that needs communication between two apps (messenger, games, etc) give it try!

### Robot Assisted Test Automation

Fanzy robot hands and fingers combined with a high speed camera that allow reproducible tests on every touchscreen. There main purpose is to test the accuracy and speed of displays and the devices in general. But there are so cool, I would love to have one of these things at work.

### Chromecast Test Automation
