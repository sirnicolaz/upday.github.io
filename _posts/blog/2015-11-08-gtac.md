## GTAC 2015

I had the honor to be invited to the GTAC 2015 in Boston. It was my first visit to Boston and I have to admit it is a real beauty. I arrived one day before the GTAC started so I had the chance to walk through this tremendeous city. It is a great feeling to sit in the morning sun on the venerable Harvard campus and watch how the future elite trots to their lectures.

I also had to spend some time at Primark, because Air Berlin managed to forget my luggage in Berlin and I needed some clothes... But this is a different story.
