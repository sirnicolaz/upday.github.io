What is the right way to be happy, productive and as innovative as possible? Well, I guess this question 
pops up in many companies and there are many books out there that give an answer to this question. 
However, I deeply believe there isnˋt  

> "the one to bind them all"

But some principles are helpful for sure
to create a healthy environment - this means for us [updudes](http://upday.github.io/about/):

* Independence - you need the freedom to make your own decisions
* You need to know what you are responsible for
* You need to know what you can expect from others - so what they are responsible/accountable for

If all this conditions come true the probability you finish your task with the highest quality, 
efficient and even have some fun in the meantime, is high.
One guide which is on every ones lips in the moment is **Holacracy**. <br>So we decided to have a closer look. 
And what did we realize? 

**It is not the "Silver Bullet" to solve all our problems. What a surprise!**

But it includes many tools that we started using to come closer to our Garden Eden.
In the next sections I describe some key aspects of Holacracy. Our experiences will be part of a follow-up post.

### The CTO is Dead - Long live the Constitution

The classical hierarchical system - one person is in charge and takes alldecision - worked pretty well for a few 
hundred years. It assumes that this person is able to take the best possible decision 
because because she foresees every requirement and fully understands the big picture. This goes true 
for some assembly lines - like producing chocolates. Becomes already unlikely if you think about fully 
automated, robotic assembly lines in car production. It is completely impossible in an agile and fast 
changing software development process. 

What could be the alternative? Anarchy, grass-roots democracy based decisions or maybe hire an almighty genius who 
knows everything? But this would be the omniscient leader again... And how would you know he knows everything?


The answer Holacracy provides is an accurate set of rules to shift the power to a constitution 
which is binding for every member of the organization. As in every other constitutional driven 
culture, this brings the freedom to take your own decisions as long as you stick to the rules. 


The provoking title of this section could suggest that Holacracy is not a hierarchical system - far 
from it! There is still someone (or even a group of people) who takes decisions for the whole company. Like a government 
may decide to build an airport, but all the technical decisions are made by someone 
who actually knows how to construct a runway or a hangar (maybe a bad example for a Berlin based company :smiley: ).
The main purpose of the constitution is to provide “roles” (who is accountable for what) and governance processes 
(fix or improve the roles).


### Role vs. Soul vs. Circle
The definition of a role consists of three elements:

 * purpose 
 * domain it controls
 * set of accountabilities and corresponding domains
 Only the purpose is mandatory, the accountabilities and domains can evolve over time. As an example you can have a look at the [developer role from GlassFrog](https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/1787) - 
 which is a web based tool developed by [HolacrcyOne](http://www.holacracy.org/). 
 
>Developer<br><br>
>Purpose:<br>
>Satisfy the customer, with Product Vision as proxy, through early and continuous delivery of truly valuable software

**Accountabilities**

Implementing GlassFrog user stories, bug fixes, and chores in alignment with: 
 * development practices set by Scrum Master 
 * implementation standards set by Quality Guardian
 * Testing new functionality before each production deployment
 * Providing input into estimation at the request of Scrum Master
 * Sharing development challenges with Product Vision, API Product Designer, and Developer as challenges arise
 * Demonstrating working software to Product Vision regularly and frequently, and integrating feedback surfaced by Product Vision
 
A definition like this makes it explicit what you can expect from a developer and on the other hand a dev 
knows what she/he is accountable for. 
There is a big difference between the persons who are working in 
an organization and the roles they hold. Decoupling these two elements allows improving the culture of 
an organization drastically. Conflicts in organizations are mostly based on disagreements between different roles involved. 
But often they are mistaken as clashes between the people holding the roles. This makes the 
conflicts personal and we try to resolve them by smoothing the personal dispute rather than resolving the underlying 
issues in the organizational structure. For example, if I as a developer need time to 
unit test a feature, this may clash with a product owner, who wants a feature out as soon as possible. So 
it seems that she/he is not trusting your judgement. But in fact the conflict is not personnel at all, 
both of your are just filling your role and there is a tension that can be used to improve the organization 
even further. [HolacrcyOne](http://www.holacracy.org/) provides a nice video that explains nicely what a tension can be:

How does the circles fit into the picture now? Well actually a circle is just an accumulation of some 
roles for a broader purpose. So basically you can say when a role becomes too much - it becomes a circle. It also follows 
the same rules - needs a purpose and a domain that it controls. In other words a circle has the autonomy and authority to 
self-organize all roles within the circle. 


This self-organization follows strict rules - which are called **governance**, which will be explained in the 
next post.

### tl;dr
Holacracy offers a comprehensive set of rules to move away from a top-down hierarchy to a **constitutional** based organization 
that consists of **roles and circles**. The objective of Holacracy is to identify so called **tensions** and harvest their energy 
to improve the organization constantly.
